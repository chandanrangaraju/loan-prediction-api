Loan Prediction API 

This is a "Flask-based Loan Prediction API" that uses a Machine Learning model to predict whether a loan will be "Approved" or "Rejected" based on user input.

---

🔹 How it Works  
1️⃣ The model takes "loan application details" as input (Gender, Income, Credit Score, etc.).  
2️⃣ The Flask API processes the request and makes a prediction.  
3️⃣ It returns "Approved" or "Rejected" based on the model's output.
